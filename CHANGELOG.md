# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each release groups changes under **Added**, **Changed**, **Deprecated**,
**Removed**, **Fixed**, and **Security** (only the relevant sections appear).
The notes published with each GitHub release mirror that version's section
here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Docker reachability: the standalone server now binds all interfaces via
  `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` instead of the Docker-assigned container-ID hostname,
  which could leave the published port unreachable and the healthcheck
  failing.
- First-run `docker compose up` no longer aborts on a missing `ADMIN_PASSWORD`:
  the `.env.example` referenced by the quick start is now included (it had been
  excluded by `.gitignore`).
- `/admin` save failures from bind-mount permissions are now documented — the
  container runs as uid/gid `1001`, so the `./config` directory must be owned
  by that user.
- The web app manifest and browser favicon now resolve to a bundled SVG app
  icon instead of a non-existent `/favicon.ico`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Automated release notes: the release workflow now publishes the GitHub
  release from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section.

### Fixed

- Admin login on plain-HTTP deployments. The session cookie is now marked
  `Secure` based on the request protocol (honoring `X-Forwarded-Proto`)
  rather than `NODE_ENV`, so browsers no longer drop it on non-HTTPS,
  non-localhost origins such as `http://<nas-ip>:3000`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-19

Initial release.

### Added

- Self-hosted dashboard with an applications grid and bookmarks grouped by
  category.
- Header showing the localized date, a time-of-day greeting, and a
  live-ticking clock.
- Weather widget powered by Open-Meteo, with configurable location and
  imperial/metric units.
- Instant client-side search across applications and bookmarks (`/` to focus,
  `Esc` to clear).
- Drag-to-reorder for applications and bookmarks in the admin UI.
- Password-protected admin UI for managing applications, bookmarks, and
  settings, backed by a single `config.yaml` file.
- Signed-cookie admin sessions with an optional dedicated `SESSION_SECRET`,
  and per-IP rate limiting on the login endpoint.
- Icon resolution from the [dashboard-icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons)
  set by slug, or any direct image URL.
- Installable PWA via a generated web app manifest, plus an `/api/health`
  liveness endpoint.
- Multi-architecture (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) Docker image published to
  GHCR, with a Docker Compose setup.
- GitHub Actions pipelines: CI (lint, tests, build) and a tag-driven release
  that builds and publishes the image.
- Vitest test suite covering config read/write and merge semantics, schema
  validation, authentication, and login rate limiting.
